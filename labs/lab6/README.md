# Lab 6: Internet Domain Name System (DNS) Lab

> Wireshark can be installed by running the command `sudo apt install wireshark` from the command line (CLI).

In NS Module 4, we learnt about the role of the Domain Name System (DNS) in Internet naming and addressing. In this lab exercise, we will go deeper into DNS by using specialised network tools to perform and analyse DNS queries. In particular, we are required to:

- Use `dig` to perform DNS queries (e.g. to look up an IP address)
- Read and interpret DNS records of different types
- Understand how a DNS query is resolved using hierarchy and recursion
- Observe and understand the effect of caching on DNS lookup times
- Use Wireshark to trace and read DNS packets sent to and from a machine
