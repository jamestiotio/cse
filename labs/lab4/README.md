# Lab 4: Internet Routes and Measure of Round Trip Times Lab

> `traceroute` can be installed by running the command `sudo apt install traceroute` from the command line (CLI). On UNIX systems, use `traceroute`. On Windows systems, use `tracert`.

In this lab, we are tasked to learn how to use `ping` and `traceroute` to measure round trip times and find network routes. In particular, we are required to:

- Understand how the `ping` and `traceroute` utilities work.
- Use the `ping` utility to measure network round trip times.
- Use the `traceroute` utility to find network routes.
- Observe and understand the effects of varying packet sizes on delays experienced.
