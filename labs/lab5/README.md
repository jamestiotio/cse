# Lab 5: Symmetric Key Encryption and Message Digest Lab

In NS Module 3, we examined how the security properties of confidentiality and data integrity could be protected by using symmetric key cryptography and signed message digests. In this lab exercise, we are tasked to write a program that makes use of DES for data encryption, MD5 for creating message digests and RSA for digital signing. In particular, we are required to:

- Understand how symmetric key cryptography (e.g., DES or AES encryption algorithms) can be used to encrypt data and protect its confidentiality.
- Understand how multiple blocks of data are handled using different block cipher modes and padding.
- Compare the different block cipher modes in terms of how they operate.
- Understand how hash functions can be used to create fixed-length message digests. 
- Understand how public key cryptography (e.g., RSA algorithm) can be used to create digital signatures.
- Understand how to create message digest using hash functions (e.g., MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-512, etc) and sign it using RSA to guarantee data integrity.
