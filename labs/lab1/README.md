# Lab 1: Process Management Lab

In this lab, we are tasked to manage a pool of UNIX resources. In particular, we are required to:

- Perform `fork()` and handle its return value
- Manage a set of processes
- Manage inter-processes communications using shared memory
- Protect shared resources with semaphores
- Manage the process pool:
  - Check the status of child processes
  - Dispatch jobs to child processes
  - Respawn (prematurely) terminated children processes
- Perform basic I/O operations
